## My Feedback

To improve the design and saving cost we need to insert longitude and latitude attributes in the scan_location table as well 
because if we call third party api everyday to get longitude and latitude for same location is costly so better to save longitude
and latitude with location in scan_location table.If next time satellite scan same location then first check in scan_location table
if exit then get longitude and latitude from it and don't need to third party api .
